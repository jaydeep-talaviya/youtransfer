This project is about file management system that offers users the ability to register, log in, and change passwords securely. The core functionality revolves around the seamless upload, storage, and sharing of various media types such as images, files, and videos. Users can simply drag and drop their desired content onto the platform, optionally adding a message and title before uploading.

Once uploaded, users can share the generated link with others, enabling them to download the content. To ensure privacy and manage storage resources efficiently, all uploaded files are automatically removed after 24 hours. Sharing is made easy through email invitations, allowing multiple users to access the same content.

Furthermore, users have access to a dashboard displaying statistics regarding their uploads and shares, providing insights into their usage patterns. A list page showcases all uploaded files for convenient reference and future sharing.

Downloads are provided in a convenient zip format, with the option to choose between single or multiple file downloads. Additionally, the platform includes a feature to download individual YouTube videos or entire playlists, expanding its utility and versatility for multimedia management.
